# 👋 Hi, I'm Tahbit Fehran

I’m a **Desktop App Developer** passionate about building elegant, cross-platform experiences with **Electron.js** and modern JavaScript frameworks. I approach software development as both a craft and a system to understand — constantly researching how new technologies can reshape user experiences.

## 🔬 What Drives Me

I’m fascinated by the intersection of **desktop software** and **decentralized systems** — researching how tools like **smart contracts**, **IPFS**, and **wallet integrations** can be brought to native desktop experiences.

My development process blends:
- 🧠 Curiosity-driven exploration
- ⚙️ Systems thinking
- 📊 Data-backed experimentation
